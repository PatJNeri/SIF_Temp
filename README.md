# SIF_Temp
Most of the pieces of ongoing reanalysis

Currently all models and data is based off of the file titled
PSIImax-Master2-24.xlsx
## (At some point this should be converted to a csv file?)

Currently the work-flow that made these files led to separate env
As such, some methods like how to read the xlsx file differ between
scripts. 
## (Still at this moment need to build a full env)
## (Still need to generate a yml file for the full env when made)

PSIIMasterAttempt2-24-21.py 
This file contains the summary process that led to the development
of the current output model, as well as some prototype graphs.
